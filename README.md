# Sales-Visual-Dashboard

Welcome to the Sales Visual Dashboard!
This dashboard provides an in-depth view of your sales performance and is designed to help you track, analyze, and make data-driven decisions. Below are key instructions and explanations on how to use the features effectively:

### 1. Key Metrics & KPIs:
Total Sales: Displays the total revenue generated within the selected time period.
Sales Growth: Shows the percentage increase or decrease in sales compared to the previous period.
Top-selling Products: Lists the highest-selling products or services, helping to identify top performers.
Sales by Region/Location: Visualizes the sales distribution across different regions or territories.

### 2. Interactive Features:
Date Filters: You can filter the data by selecting a specific date range using the "Date" filter at the top of the dashboard. The dashboard will dynamically update to reflect the selected period (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
Drill-through Functionality: Click on any bar, line, or data point in the visuals to explore deeper insights for that category (e.g., click on a region to see detailed sales performance for that region).
Segmentation Filters: Use the dropdown menus to segment your data by various factors such as product category, customer type, or sales rep. This allows you to zoom into specific aspects of the sales data.

### 3. Understanding the Visuals:
Line Chart (Sales Trend): Displays the sales trends over time. The solid line represents actual sales, while the dashed line shows target or forecasted sales. You can hover over the data points to see detailed sales figures for specific dates.
Bar/Column Chart (Top Products): Lists the products with the highest sales volume or revenue. The larger the bar, the higher the sales.
Pie Chart (Customer Segmentation): Breaks down your sales by customer type (e.g., new customers, returning customers). Each segment represents a percentage of total sales.
